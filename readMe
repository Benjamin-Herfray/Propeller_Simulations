Files and directories from before simulation: 
0.orig, constant (less polyMesh), system, Allclean, Allprep, Allrun


Numbered directories: 
recorded field data after n iterations (e.g. 200 folder has field after 200 iterations). Final solution in 3000.


processor directories: 
field data within the domain assigned to each processor before the computational domain was reconstructed.


5425RPM.foam:
The file that is viewed in Paraview


actuatorDiskForce.vtk:
A file containing a point cloud of propeller outer geometry for viewing the propeller in Paraview


SimulationData:
Contains information about field values along the radial direction. The last three numbers denote the axial distance from the propeller at which values were taken (e.g., 354 is 3.54 propeller diameters away). There is also a record of the core velocity plotted as a function of distance behind the axis, and a testorig file recording field values as a function of radius at the propeller plane.


There is also a screenshot of the residual plot. All other files are various logs of the applications run during and before the simulation.
